# Job application monitoring system

Problem statement:
Jobs are applied via various portals, recruiters revert with a different email id of acceptance/rejection. Your inbox is the single source of truth.

It is 2025, spray and pray will not work and ideally there should be an excel sheet
with list of companies applied to. If the outreach is intentional, that list should be pretty small and easy to track manually.

But most of us don't do that. Easy Apply gives the sense of accomplishment and we forget the application in the giant pile of emails.

So, what if there is a program that you can run locally, that polls your gmail and maintains the list for you?

This project is an attempt at that.
